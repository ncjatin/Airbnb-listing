# Airbnb-listing
Business Problem-
Identify good and bad listings in the given dataset. This will help the company avoid bad listings from being put up on their platform and pull them down if already there so that customer impact and dissatisfaction is minimal

I have not uploaded csv file for Airbnb since it is very large.
And i have worked for on 1lac data points out of 3.5 lac datapoints which also include text data.
