Just too much traffic! We are pretty close to the illustrious Loyola University just east of us in Rogers Park.  I'm also close to Evanston, so perhaps if you're involved with Northwestern University for your stay, this would be a good match (outside of actually staying in Evanston).  I think I already mentioned my proximity to Indian food. Yep. I live two blocks from the best in the city. I must mention that this location is not in the best part of town for public transportation. We are only close to bus lines, not train lines, and as such this is not the most efficient way of exploring Chicago as a tourist.

Parking on my block is usually easy to find, but be careful, parking on Campbell NORTH of my house does have permit restrictions.  Otherwise we are close to a couple major bus routes that can get you where you need to go or they can get you to the El train, which is the preferred method of getting around Chicago.  I do caution potential guests that this listing is not situated near the train. And, Chicago buses do not run as late or as frequently as the train.

       "0  I love that my neighborhood is so quiet and low-key. I understand you'll probably want to visit places like Wicker Park, but I can't understand wanting to live there. Just too much traffic! We are pretty close to the illustrious Loyola University just east of us in Rogers Park.  I'm also close to Evanston, so perhaps if you're involved with Northwestern University for your stay, this would be a good match (outside of actually staying in Evanston).  I think I already mentioned my proximity to Indian food. Yep. I live two blocks from the best in the city. I must mention that this location is not in the best part of town for public transportation. We are only close to bus lines, not train lines, and as such this is not the most efficient way of exploring Chicago as a tourist. We are a good location if you are driving, or if you are visiting friends and family that are not far from us.   \n",

Parking on my block is usually easy to find, but be careful, parking on Campbell NORTH of my house does have permit restrictions.  Otherwise we are close to a couple major bus routes that can get you where you need to go or they can get you to the El train, which is the preferred method of getting around Chicago.  I do caution potential guests that this listing is not situated near the train. And, Chicago buses do not run as late or as frequently as the train. As such, I want all guests here as a tourist to understand that booking here means getting around to all the sites of Chicago is a bit more tedious than other places you might find.   \n",

Just too much traffic! We are pretty close to the illustrious Loyola University just east of us in Rogers Park.  I'm also close to Evanston, so perhaps if you're involved with Northwestern University for your stay, this would be a good match (outside of actually staying in Evanston).  I think I already mentioned my proximity to Indian food. Yep. I live two blocks from the best in the city. I must mention that this location is not in the best part of town for public transportation. We are only close to bus lines, not train lines, and as such this is not the most efficient way of exploring Chicago as a tourist.

Parking on my block is usually easy to find, but be careful, parking on Campbell NORTH of my house does have permit restrictions.  Otherwise we are close to a couple major bus routes that can get you where you need to go or they can get you to the El train, which is the preferred method of getting around Chicago.  I do caution potential guests that this listing is not situated near the train. And, Chicago buses do not run as late or as frequently as the train.

       "0  I love that my neighborhood is so quiet and low-key. I understand you'll probably want to visit places like Wicker Park, but I can't understand wanting to live there. Just too much traffic! We are pretty close to the illustrious Loyola University just east of us in Rogers Park.  I'm also close to Evanston, so perhaps if you're involved with Northwestern University for your stay, this would be a good match (outside of actually staying in Evanston).  I think I already mentioned my proximity to Indian food. Yep. I live two blocks from the best in the city. I must mention that this location is not in the best part of town for public transportation. We are only close to bus lines, not train lines, and as such this is not the most efficient way of exploring Chicago as a tourist. We are a good location if you are driving, or if you are visiting friends and family that are not far from us.   \n",

       "0  Parking around here is very easy. You might wind up parking as much as two blocks away if you return after 10 pm, but this isn't a big deal, as I mentioned, this neighborhood is very safe. Parking on my block is usually easy to find, but be careful, parking on Campbell NORTH of my house does have permit restrictions.  Otherwise we are close to a couple major bus routes that can get you where you need to go or they can get you to the El train, which is the preferred method of getting around Chicago.  I do caution potential guests that this listing is not situated near the train. And, Chicago buses do not run as late or as frequently as the train. As such, I want all guests here as a tourist to understand that booking here means getting around to all the sites of Chicago is a bit more tedious than other places you might find.   \n",
